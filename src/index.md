## University of Michigan Salary Visualizations
This project contains a rough collection of visualizations of University of Michigan salary and employment data, based on year. I might assume anyone trying to find employment with the University of Michigan may want to search a position's stated title in the most current year to have an understanding of the actual salary range of the position.

## Methods
The base dataset was constructed by downloading the annual salary disclosure reports from the University of Michigan Human Resources website, located at the ["Find Existing or Standard Report" page](https://hr.umich.edu/working-u-m/management-administration/hr-data-analytics-services/find-existing-or-standard-report). Raw data was extracted from the salary table provided in the report via [Tabula](https://tabula.technology/), and exported to CSV. The salary data was then formatted in [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/), to be exported to CSV for use here.

These reports are constructed and managed via Observable's [Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework/) and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/jshwlkr/umsalary). Contributions are welcome.

## Motivation
Mostly, I wanted an excuse to learn how to use the Observable Framework. I also think the general practice of obfuscating an applicant's pay range is not an appropriate practice.
